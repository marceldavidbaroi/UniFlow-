"Develop a real-time collaborative learning platform for university students using Quasar and Firebase. Features include: role-based authentication (student, teacher, admin), class session management (creation, joining via unique ID), task assignment with file uploads and online code editor submissions, real-time collaborative coding with live sharing and chat, a leaderboard for task scores, and an admin panel for user/session management. Prioritize real-time functionality, a responsive UI, and secure data handling."

        * **Student:** Standard user with class access.
        * **Teacher:** Class creation, management, and grading.
        * **Admin:** User management, authorization, and system-wide controls.
    * **Authorization:** Firebase Rules to secure data based on roles.
    * **Teacher ID:** Unique identifier for teachers, separate from their email.
    * **Admin Panel:** Securely accessible interface for admins.

2.  **Class Sessions:**
    * **Session Creation:** Teacher creates sessions with:
        * Date/Time
        * Unique Session ID (generated by the system)
        * Class Name/Subject
        * Student enrollment.
    * **Session Management:** Teacher can:
        * Add/remove students.
        * Edit session details.
        * End the session.
    * **Student Joining:** Students join using their credentials and the unique Session ID.

3.  **Task Management:**
    * **Task Creation:** Teacher assigns tasks with:
        * Title/Description
        * Due Date/Time
        * Attachments (documents, videos, links) stored in Firebase Storage.
        * Score/Grading parameters.
    * **Student Submission:**
        * Students submit tasks through the platform.
        * File uploads (Firebase Storage).
        * Online editor code submission.
    * **Grading:** Teacher reviews submissions, provides feedback, and assigns scores.

4.  **Real-time Collaborative Coding:**
    * **Online Code Editor:** Integration with a real-time editor (e.g., CodeMirror, Monaco Editor, or a cloud-based IDE like CodeSandbox's API).
    * **Live Coding (Teacher):** Teacher can code live, with changes reflected in real-time for students.
    * **Student Coding:** Students can code independently and share their code with the teacher.
    * **Live Code Sharing:** Students can share their code with the teacher in real-time for assistance.
    * **Real-time Chat:** Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for live chat between teacher and students within the session.

5.  **Leaderboard:**
    * Displays student scores and submission status for each task.
    * Real-time updates.
    * Filtering and sorting options (e.g., by task, by student).

6.  **Admin Panel:**
    * **User Management:**
        * View all users (students, teachers, admins).
        * Authorize new users.
        * Delete accounts.
        * Change user roles.
    * **Session Management:**
        * View all sessions.
        * Delete sessions.
    * **System Logs:** Track admin actions and system events.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:**
    * Quasar Framework (Vue.js) for a responsive and cross-platform UI.
    * Real time code editors(Monaco, CodeMirror).
* **Backend:**
    * Firebase Authentication for user management.
    * Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage (sessions, tasks, submissions, chat).
    * Firebase Realtime database for real time chat.
    * Firebase Storage for file uploads (documents, videos, student submissions).
    * Firebase Cloud Functions (optional) for server-side logic and tasks (e.g., automated notifications, data processing).
* **Real-time Collaboration:**
    * Possible integration with WebRTC for enhanced real time features.

**Architecture Considerations:**

* **Component-Based Design:** Utilize Quasar's component system for modular and maintainable code.
* **State Management:** Vuex or Pinia for managing application state.
* **Firebase Security Rules:** Implement robust security rules to protect data.
* **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling and user feedback.
* **Scalability:** Design the application with scalability in mind, considering potential growth.
* **User Experience (UX):** Focus on a clean, intuitive, and engaging user interface.
* **Responsiveness:** Ensure the application works seamlessly on different devices (desktops, tablets, mobile).

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    * Create a Firebase project.
    * Set up Quasar CLI.
    * Install Firebase SDK.
2.  **Authentication:**
    * Implement Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google).
    * Create login, logout, and signup components.
3.  **Database Design:**
    * Design Firestore collections and documents (users, sessions, tasks, submissions).
4.  **Session Management:**
    * Implement session creation, joining, and management.
5.  **Task Management:**
    * Implement task creation, submission, and grading.
6.  **Real-time Collaboration:**
    * Integrate the online code editor.
    * Implement live coding and code sharing.
    * Implement real time chat.
7.  **Leaderboard:**
