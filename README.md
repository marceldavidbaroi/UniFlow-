# Collaborative Learning Hub (or Live Classroom Connect)

A real-time collaborative learning platform for university students, built with Quasar Framework and Firebase.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive online learning environment that facilitates seamless collaboration between students and teachers. It leverages the power of Quasar Framework for a responsive user interface and Firebase for real-time data management and authentication.

## Core Features

- **Authentication and Authorization:**
  -      Firebase Authentication (email/password, Google, etc.).
  -      Role-based access control (Student, Teacher, Admin).
  -      Unique Teacher ID.
  -      Secure Admin Panel.
- **Class Sessions:**
  -      Session creation with date/time, unique ID, and subject.
  -      Session management (add/remove students, edit details, end sessions).
  -      Student joining via unique Session ID.
- **Task Management:**
  -      Task creation with descriptions, due dates, and attachments (Firebase Storage).
  -      Student submissions (file uploads, online code editor).
  -      Teacher grading and feedback.
- **Real-time Collaborative Coding:**
  -      Integrated online code editor (Monaco, CodeMirror).
  -      Live coding and code sharing.
  -      Real-time chat (Firebase Realtime Database/Firestore).
- **Leaderboard:**
  -      Displays student scores and submission status.
  -      Real-time updates, filtering, and sorting.
- **Admin Panel:**
  -      User management (view, authorize, delete, change roles).
  -      Session management (view, delete).
  -      System logs.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**
  -      [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) (Vue.js)
  - Real time code editors(Monaco, CodeMirror).
- **Backend:**
  -      [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
  - [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
  - [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database)
  - [Firebase Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage)
  - [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) (optional)
  - Possible integration with WebRTC for enhanced real time features.

## Architecture Considerations
